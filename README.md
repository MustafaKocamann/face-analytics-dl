# 🎯 Face Attribute Detection with DeepFace

This project applies deep learning techniques to detect key facial attributes such as **age**, **gender**, **race**, and **emotion** from a set of images using the [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) library.

## 🔍 Project Overview

As an entry-level deep learning project, I analyzed 15 face images both **individually** and **collectively** to identify:

- 🧓 Age  
- 🚻 Gender  
- 🌍 Race  
- 😊 Emotion  

This allowed me to gain hands-on experience with computer vision, facial analysis, and pre-trained models.

## 🧠 Technologies & Libraries Used

- `DeepFace` – pre-trained face analysis models  
- `OpenCV (cv2)` – image processing and reading  
- `matplotlib` – visualization  
- `pandas` – data organization and handling  
- `Python` – general scripting and logic
